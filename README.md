🚀 PixiJS Crash Game
A "Crash" style game (similar to those seen in crypto gaming) built from scratch with TypeScript and the PixiJS 2D rendering engine. This project features a real-time, round-based game loop, player balance, and betting controls.

It is built using a no-bundler, ES Module setup, relying on an importmap in the HTML to load PixiJS from a CDN.
