## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

You can run the project in two ways:

### 1. Simple Mode (One-Time Build)

This command builds the project once and serves it. You will have to stop and re-run it to see any code changes.

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build and run
npm start
